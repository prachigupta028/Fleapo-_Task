                <p>Cryptocurrency adoption is at less than 1% of the global world population with some countries and entities actively fighting against its mass adoption and the smartest developers and nerds holding the fort. </p>
                <p>

                    Bitcoin was the first, and it has since grown to thousands of tokens launched all aiming to fix one problem or the other with some quite simply FOMOing the moment.

So down that even a celebrity can explain it in simple words to their followers and have them download an app, buy into the social currency of their favourite person and watch their
                    investment as is with other crypto currency project. </p>
                    
                    <p>We are trying to do to this space what investment apps did for the "nonexistent retail investors". We are gamefying digital currency, bringing in popular faces instead of hard to understand projects to make it the norm and inadvertently being the "gateway drug" for a lot of people to finally give this space a real look. </p>
                    <p>A new digital economy is coming. People would be just as powerful as countries and creators would be paid beyond the peanuts that conventional social media platforms can offer. </p>

                        <p>There would be new markets and advertisers with little to offer would not find home there. Like Kanye said, </p>
